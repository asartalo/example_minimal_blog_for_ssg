Ideas are cheap. That's great. Expend just a few calories and after a while, we
have a lot of them. Executing on them is harder.<!-- more -->

I have, well... ideas. Quite a lot of them have been recorded but not a lot have
been built.

I have tried building things in the past but none of them were ever completed
or felt finished. I hope to change that and that's where this site comes in.
With this site, I hope to track my progress in taking some of these ideas to
reality and to also document my thoughts along the way.

This site itself is an idea I had years ago that never quite got the time it
needed and most importantly the pragmatism it deserved. I intended it to be
feature-rich like an actual project tracking site. Eventually all that
complexity made it difficult for me to even get started. Because of it, I built
a less than half-baked version out of frustration.

I hope to approach things differently now and hopefully a lot more ideas can
become reality. There are things that I still need to work on like being more
pragmatic or deciding when a project is done. These are skills I hope to learn
along the way with more experience.

Here's to [making things
